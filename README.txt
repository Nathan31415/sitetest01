WELCOME to the wonderful world of Americooking!

Unfortunately this experience was designed by an inexperienced web student who doesn't quite know 
how to properly scale sites for screen sizes and instead naively used pixel measurements too much of the time.

This site was designed for an FCPS Dell student laptop, but will probably work similarly on any low resolution 4:3 screen.

the main page is designated 1.9_RecipePage01.html, but honestly just look for the one that has the 01 on the end

Have fun! maybe!
